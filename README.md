# Empire-Stats-Visualization
A series of pages (may develop to be a react app or something similarly cohesive) to help visualize stat distributions for the Tabletop RPG Empire


## Plans:

- use d3 and js to generate and visualize data sets for empire
  - character stats
  - maybe weapons with stats
  - maybe allow import of character from character creator as stretch goal?
- maybe make react app?

## todo:

- add D3
- mockup?
